About Me
I am a final-year Computer Science student with a strong foundation in software development and a passion for building intelligent applications. My experience includes an AI Research Internship at Alignerr.ai, where I evaluated and benchmarked large language models for code generation tasks. I enjoy the entire development lifecycle, from conceptualizing and designing backend systems to creating intuitive user interfaces. I am actively seeking challenging roles in Software Engineering and Data Science where I can apply my skills in Python, AI, and full-stack development to contribute to innovative projects.
